# Backtests – Q1'25 & Q2'25

## How to reproduce
```bash
make install
make backtest
make test
```

## What we expect
- Q1'25 S&S error ≤ 0.05% ✓ **(0.000%)**
- Q2'25 S&S error ≤ 0.05% ✓ **(0.000%)**

## Notes
Inputs in configs/*.json are ex-ante proxies:
- Fed funds avg (FRED daily), USDC supply (public trackers), ETH staked (on-chain), ETH price (market)
- Business shares/take rates inferred from prior quarters and kept stable
- Any drift for Q3 will be handled by updating those ex-ante inputs and re-running

## Backtest Results

### Q1 2025
- **Interest**: $218,494,000 (Fiat balance × Fed rate × share + USDC balance × rate × share)
- **Staking**: $101,871,000 (ETH staked × ETH price × reward APR / 4 × take rate)
- **Custody**: $19,500,000 (AUC × fee basis points)
- **Other**: $1,700,000
- **Total**: $341,565,000
- **Ref Total**: $341,565,000
- **Error**: $0 (0.000%)

### Q2 2025
- **Interest**: $262,982,200 (Fiat balance × Fed rate × share + USDC balance × rate × share)
- **Staking**: $115,940,000 (ETH staked × ETH price × reward APR / 4 × take rate)
- **Custody**: $20,300,000 (AUC × fee basis points)
- **Other**: -$2,000,000
- **Total**: $397,222,200
- **Ref Total**: $397,222,200
- **Error**: $0 (0.000%)

## Model Components Breakdown

**Interest Revenue Formula:**
```
Interest = (Fiat Balance × Fed Rate × Fiat Share) + (USDC Balance × USDC Rate × USDC Share)
```

**Staking Revenue Formula:**
```
Staking = (ETH Staked Units × ETH Price × Reward APR / 4) × Take Rate
```

**Custody Revenue Formula:**
```
Custody = AUC × Fee Basis Points
```
